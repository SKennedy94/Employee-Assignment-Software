		                    <h2>What problem are we trying to solve?</h2>
                            <p>Many companies hire employees who can wear many different hats on the job. For example, let's say that Bob works at JC Penney. Bob can be a cashier, he can help re-organize the store, he can help manage inventory, etc. 
                            There are many different job roles that Bob can tackle based on necessity and what needs to get done. A manager will typically sit down and create a schedule for the day. The manner in which the manager decides to assign employees to 
                            different stations / job roles can be cumbersome and tedious. We propose a solution that will trivialize this task and allow the manager to be able to allocate more time on more important duties.</p>

                            <h2><a href="https://github.com/ggkfox/Employee-Assignment-Software/wiki#what-is-the-employee-assignment-system-ets"></a>What is the Employee Assignment Software (EAS)?</h2>
                            <p>Our vision is to provide a software that helps businesses ensure that their hard working employees are not asked to do the same tasks day after day. The Employee Tracking System is a web application that allows employers / managers to 
                            upload a daily schedule which consists of an Excel file (.xlsx) where each row will have the details of an employee. Rather than an employer wasting precious time having to manually assign employees, our software will do it for them and 
                            allow them more time to focus on more important issues. Once the employees have been added, our software will assign positions to each employee who was listed on the schedule. If the employees are brand new, their placement will be random. 
                            However, if the employees have work history recorded in our software, their placement will be based on where they are most needed. A complete breakdown of this process can be found in our "How It Works" section.</p>
