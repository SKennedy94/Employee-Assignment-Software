How to run the application:

	STEP 1: Open up a Cloud9 account and create a Node.js workspace.
	
	STEP 2: Delete everything inside that workspace. Then do git clone https://github.com/ggkfox/CSCI-150.git
	
	STEP 3: Type "node -v" to check the version of Node.js. If it is 6.xx.x then you need to type "nvm install 8" 
		    which will install Node v. 8.5.0. Once you typed that command, type "node -v" again to make sure you
		    are running Node 8.
		    
		    NOTE: You only need to do "nvm install 8" once. Afterwards, all you would need to do is "nvm use 8" 
		    to switch to 8 if needed.
		    
	STEP 4: Type "npm install -g nodemon"
			Nodemon is a tool we are using so that we don't need to constantly recompile our application every 
			time we make a change.
			
	STEP 5: Make sure that the MongoDB server is running. Type "./mongod" and then open up a separate terminal. If
			the server is not runnign for some reason, type "./mongod --repair" and then "./mongod" and it will work.
	
	STEP 6: cd into the CSCI-150 folder then type "npm install" which will install a node_modules folder.
			
	STEP 7: Then type "nodemon server.js" and this will start the server. Click on the "Preview" button next to the run
			button and choose "Preview Running Application." A window will pop up. Copy the url and close that window
			and enter a link in another browser tab.
